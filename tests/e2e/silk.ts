 * Amendment 16 (FR-050, FR-125 to FR-128): Amazon Fire tablets with the Silk browser, which is based on Chromium.
 * Silk's tablet user agent follows the template in the Amazon Silk Developer Guide
 * (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/silk/latest/developerguide/user-agent.html); the model codes come from Amazon's Fire
 * tablet specifications (KFQUWI Fire 7 2022, KFRASWI Fire HD 8 2024, KFTUWI Fire HD 10 2023). The Android, build and
 * Silk version numbers are examples (Fire OS 8 is based on Android 11); the game does not read the user agent.
